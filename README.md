# Portfolio

I developed a portfolio website using React, integrating Framer Motion for smooth animations and React Material UI for a modern, responsive design. The website features a clean, minimalist layout, showcasing my work and skills. Framer Motion allowed for fluid transitions and interactive elements, enhancing the user experience, while Material UI ensured consistent styling and component-based development. This project highlights my proficiency in modern web development tools and libraries, combining aesthetics with functionality.
